  <h3>Punctuation</h3>
  <p> Punctuation marks help you to organise your words into clauses and sentences, and hence into identifiable units of meaning. They are the signs that alert readers to the appropriate pauses in your text. These pauses signal where you intend the emphasis and intonation to be placed, and thus how you want the text to be read. Punctuation marks help you tell the reader how to find the meaning from your organisation of the words.</p>
  <p> Thus, punctuation is more than just an incidental aspect of writing. It is an essential skill that helps you to express yourself clearly, directly and effectively.</p>

  <div class="tabs">
    <input type="radio" name="tabs" id="tabone" checked="checked">
    <label for="tabone">End marks</label>
    <div class="tab">
      <h3>End marks</h3>
      <p> End marks are used to end a sentence. They enable you to tell your reader where one thought ends and another begins. Thus, end marks help you keep your ideas distinct so that your reader can understand what you have written.</p>
      <p class="heavy"> Full stop</p>
      <ul class="a">
    	  <li> This sentence finishes with a full stop.</li>
    	  <li> This sentence does not!</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heavy"> Exclamation mark </p>
      <p> An exclamation mark should be used when you intend the sentence to be either a strong command or an emphatic declaration.</p>
      <p> For example:</p>
      <ul class="a">
    	  <li> Do as you are told! [strong command]</li>
    	  <li> Idiot! [emphatic declaration].</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heavy"> Question mark </p>
      <p> This is used to indicate a direct question.</p>
      <p> For example:</p>
      <ul class="a">
    	  <li> What did you mean by that outrageous claim?]</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <input type="radio" name="tabs" id="tabtwo">
    <label for="tabtwo">Commas</label>
    <div class="tab">
      <h3>Commas</h3>
      <p> Being able to identify <b>independent</b> and <b>dependent clauses</b> will help you to decide where to put commas (or other punctuation) in your writing.</p>
      <p>An <b>independent clause</b> contains a subject and a verb.</p>
      <p>For example: <b>The tree was losing its leaves.</b></p>
      <p>So it is a complete sentence in itself. However, a <b>dependent clause</b> cannot stand on its own. If it is written alone, it doesn't make sense. It is an incomplete sentence. This is because it is usually missing a subject, or a verb or both.</p>
      <p>For example: <b> Because of the drought.</b></p>
      <p> We join dependent and independent clauses together to ensure:</p>
      <ol class="b">
      	<li> The meaning is clear: The tree was losing its leaves because of the drought.</li>
      	<li>The sentence is complete: Because of the drought, the tree was losing its leaves.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> Commas are needed to clarify meaning when dependent and independent clauses are added to each other to form complex sentences.</p>
      <p> The general rules with commas in complex sentences are:</p>
      <ol class="b">
      	<li> If the dependent clause comes after the independent clause (highlighted), no comma is necessary.<br>
             Village councils play the main role in resolving disputes and meting out justice.</li>
      	<li> If the dependent clause is before the independent clause, you need a comma.<br>
             Outside of the major cities, village councils play the main role in resolving disputes and meting out justice.</li>
      	<li> If the dependent clause is in the middle of an independent clause or in the middle of two independent clauses, you need a comma each side of it. <br> The whole parliament, aside from the President, agreed with the proposed legislation.
             Zahra’s family, who had lived in a small village all their lives, suddenly decided to move to the city. Tehran, with a population of more than twenty million, is a busy, chaotic city</li>
      </ol>
      <p class=“heavy”> Other uses of the comma</p>
      <p> Use a comma <b>to separate the elements in a list.</b></p>
      <ul class="a">
      	<li> We need stationery, blackboards and easels for each school.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Use a comma + a conjunction (and, but, for, nor, yet, or, so) <b>to connect two independent clauses</b></p>
      <ul class="a">
      	<li>The kittens were very cute, but they were really out of control. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Use a comma <b>to separate adjectives<b> (descriptive words)<p>
      <ul class="a">
      	<li> That run-down, dilapidated cottage with the overgrown garden. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> If you can put an <i>and</i> or a <i>but</i> between the adjectives, a comma will probably belong there.</p>
      <ul class="a">
        <li> For instance, you could say, "I live in a very old and run-down house."<li>
      </ul>

      <p> Use a comma <b>to set off quoted elements.</b> Because we don't use quoted material all the time, even when writing, this is probably the most difficult rule to remember in comma usage.</p>
      <p> Williams (2003) said, “It is highly unlikely that school improvement projects really work as they are intended.”</p>
      <p> Use commas to set off phrases that express contrast. .</p>
      <p> Some say the world will end in ice, not fire. .</p>
      <p> Use a comma <b>to avoid confusion</b> or misunderstanding. .</p>
      <ul class="a">
      	<li>For most, the year is already finished.</li>
      	<li>Woman without her man would be useless. </li>
      	<li>Woman, without her, man would be useless</li>
     </ul>
     <p> Typographical Reasons: .</p>
     <p> Use a comma between a town and a state [Bendigo, Victoria], a date and the year [June 15, 1997], </p>
    </div>

    <input type="radio" name="tabs" id="tabthree">
    <label for="tabthree">Colons</label>
    <div class="tab">
      <h3>Colons</h3>
      <p>Colons (written as : ) are used mainly to introduce lists, summaries, or quotations. For example: </p>
      <p>A list: </p>
      <ul class="a">
      	<li>You will need the following: four cups of flour, three eggs, one cup of sugar, one teaspoon of vanilla flavouring, and some imagination.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A summary: </p>
      <p>The company's financial position can be summarised in one word: disastrous. </p>
      <p>A quote: </p>
      <p>Within western philosophy, for a man the question of the sex of his body does not arise: A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; it goes without saying that he is a man (de Beauvoir 1988, 15). </p>
    </div>

    <input type="radio" name="tabs" id="tabfour">
    <label for="tabfour">Semicolons</label>
    <div class="tab">
      <h3>Semicolons</h3>
      <p>Semicolons (written as ;) are used to link two closely related Independent sentences. For example: </p>
      <p>The chef prepared the fancy dishes; the assistants did the rest. </p>
      <p>The students entered through the main doors; the lecturers had their own entrance. </p>
      <p>You can also use a semicolon to separate comma-containing phrases within a list. For example: </p>
      <ul class="a">
      	<li>We shall need three tents; six rucksacks containing tools, first aid kits, and insect repellents; six utilities pouches for maps, small hand tools, spare batteries and compasses; and six two-way radios.</li>
      </ul>
